```bash
# purge some built-in games
sudo dnf remove kmahjongg kmines kpatience kpat -y
# install steam
sudo dnf install steam -y
# launch steam from terminal if it crashes, launch as:
# this would be needed only at the first lauch
__GL_CONSTANT_FRAME_RATE_HINT=3 steam
```

Then launch `Steam`, log-in to account, navigate to `Settings` and on tabs:

- `Library`:
	- Enable `Low Bandwith Mode`
	- Enable `Low Performance Mode`
	- Select `Disable Community Content` 
- `Downloads`:
	- Enable `Allow background processing of Vulkan shaders`
- `Compatibility`
	- Select `Enable Steam Play for all other titles` (this will require Steam to restart)


Remark: In some games in full-screen mode the ghosting mouse movement can appear when changing the game resolution. Can be fixed with going to windowed-mode, changing resolution, saving changes, and going back to full-screen mode. 

For some game might need to try the exact used version of Proton. Per say for RTCW, Proton Hotfix version didn't work, but Proton Experimental worked like a charm.
