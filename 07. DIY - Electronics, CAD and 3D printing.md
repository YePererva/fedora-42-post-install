```bash
# For some reason flatpak has more recent version and dnf
flatpak install --from https://flathub.org/repo/appstream/org.kicad.KiCad.flatpakref

# Freecad is only in snap, not in dnf
# both versions are not fresh. Currently 1.0.1 in repos 1.0.0
sudo snap install freecad
# flatpak install flathub org.freecad.FreeCAD

# PrusaSlicer
sudo dnf install prusa-slicer

# OrcaSlicer
wget https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases/download/v2.3.0/OrcaSlicer-Linux-flatpak_V2.3.0_x86_64.flatpak
flatpak install ./OrcaSlicer-Linux-flatpak_V2.3.0_x86_64.flatpak
