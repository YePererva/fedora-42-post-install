According to documentation [web-site](https://rpmfusion.org/):

```bash
sudo dnf up --refresh
sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core -y
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
sudo dnf group upgrade core
sudo dnf install rpmfusion-free-release-tainted 
sudo dnf install fedora-workstation-repositories
sudo dnf config-manager setopt fedora-cisco-openh264.enabled=1
```

If during setting-up you connected any additional drive (ntfs, etc.), at this point go to the `/etc/fstab` and adjust default `ro` permissions to `rw`, add input layout(s), and adjust the layout switching combo, and define the default behaviour of NumLock button. If you have dual-boot, better to make it defined.

## Dual-boot related access to NTFS

You must restart Windows and turn off fast boot and hibernate before shutting down to be able to write to the NTFS drives from Fedora.  Windows Terminal as Admin â†’ `powercfg /h off` to turn off fast start. 

Or check out how to do it graphically [here](https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht513773-how-to-enable-or-disable-fast-startup-on-windows-11). Graphical option might be unavailable on laptops since Windows by default pushes `Balanced` power plan as the only option.
