Make account with STMicroelectronics. For developing without STM32CubeIDE : consider having [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html)

#### STM32CubeIDE

Download and unpack [STM32CubeIDE](http://st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) to `~\Downloads` and navigate into the unpacked folder

```bash
# to install all STM32Cube IDE
sudo sh st-stm32cubeide_*.rpm_bundle.sh
```

Now, you can delete installer. Run STM32CubeIDE, in the top menu `Help` → `STM32Cube Updates` → `Connection to my ST`.

Enter your credentials and tick `Remember on this computer`

#### STLink firmware utility 

Better to have it since it is being updated more often than built-in in IDE. It is used as something portable, not a system-wide installation.

Download and unpack [STLink Firmware Upgrade Utility](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html) to `~\Downloads`

If the this is the fresh installation, some prerequisites and rules are needed to use it

```bash
cd ./stsw-link007/AllPlatforms/
sudo rpm -Uhv ./StlinkRulesFilesForLinux/st-stlink-udev-rules*.rpm
# this should install Java 24
sudo dnf install java-latest-openjdk
# configure its use via
sudo alternatives --config java
# and make usere that java 24 is the default by running
java --version
```

Ta actually run the updater:
```bash
java -jar STLinkUpgrade.jar
```

Without adjusting java executable, I was receiving this error:
```
HeadlessException: No X11 DISPLAY variable was set
```

#### STM32CubeProgrammer

Useful for reading firmware, purging MCU firmware, setting-up the protection, etc. Download and unpack [STM32Cube Programmer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html) into `~\Downloads`. Run either:

```bash
# for user-wide installation
./SetupSTM32CubeProgrammer-2.19.0.linux

# for system-wide instalaltion
sudo ./SetupSTM32CubeProgrammer-2.19.0.linux
```

Now, you can run it from the menu and delete the installer.

#### STM32CubeMonitor

So far, there is no plan to support RPM package from STMicroelectronics. Proof : [post](https://community.st.com/t5/stm32cubemonitor-mcus/is-there-a-rpm-package-of-stm32cubemonitor/m-p/224300) in community forum. The way around is described by either [mobilinkd](https://github.com/mobilinkd/STM32CubeMonitor) or [here](https://github.com/YePererva/stm32cubemon_container)

#### STM32CubeMonitor - Power, RF and UPCD

Download and unpack to `~/Downloads`:
- [STM32CubeMonPwr](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-performance-and-debuggers/stm32cubemonpwr.html)
- [STM32CubeMonRF](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-performance-and-debuggers/stm32cubemonrf.html)
- [STM32CubeMonUCPD](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-performance-and-debuggers/stm32cubemonucpd.html)

Unpack each until you get the bare `*.jar` file and run either:

```bash
# for per user installation
java -jar SetupSTM32CubeMonitor-Power.jar
java -jar SetupSTM32CubeMonitor-UCPD.jar
tar -xf STM32CMonRFLin.tar && java -jar setupSTM32CubeMonitor-RF.jar
# for per machine installation
sudo java -jar SetupSTM32CubeMonitor-Power.jar
sudo java -jar SetupSTM32CubeMonitor-UCPD.jar
tar -xf STM32CMonRFLin.tar && sudo java -jar setupSTM32CubeMonitor-RF.jar
```

If using KDE Plasma, move those shortcuts in menu to `Development` category or to STMicroelectronics CubeMonitor if it was installed previously.


## Alternative combo: CLion + STM32CubeMX

Clion [documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/embedded-development.html#open-project) on combines set-up

```bash
# Extra components
dnf install ncurses-compat-libs arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs
```
